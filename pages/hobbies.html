    I was born and bred in my hometown of Portland, Oregon, also known as the City of Roses. 
    As a native 'Portlagorian', I love my city and what the surrounding areas have to offer.
    
    Directly to our north is the Columbia River, the second largest river in North America.  
    The Pacific ocean is a two hour drive from our city limits.  And skiing on Mt. Hood is 
    less than an hour away. 
    I really enjoy watching our local MLS team, the Portland Timbers.

      In my free time, I like speaking with my two adult children, playing in a beer league for ice hockey, and I'm trying to learn as much as I can about robotics.
