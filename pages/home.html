  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Hello, I'm a dedicated computational linguist with a passion for machine translation, 
    breaking down language barriers, and helping rebuild the Tower of Babel, one brick 
    at a time.</p>

      <p>
        I'm currently a PhD student in computer science at Portland State University. 
        A product of an immigrant father from Montenegro and a mother who taught ESL, 
        I grew up in a multilingual household and traveled frequently to Europe. This 
        early exposure to different languages and cultures sparked my lifelong 
        fascination with language and the power of communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also inspired to study technology after watching Star Wars as a child. 
        My favorite character was C3PO, a protocol droid "fluent in over six million 
        forms of communication" as he liked to boast.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <i><strong>My goal is to help people communicate better, no matter what 
          language they speak.</strong></i>
        I believe that language is a bridge that connects us all, and I'm committed to 
        building technology that makes communication easier and more accessible for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>And that's computational linguistics. The perfect fusion of computers and language.</p>
