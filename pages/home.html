  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="lead">Hello, I'm a dedicated computational linguist with a passion for machine translation, breaking down language barriers, and helping rebuild the Tower of Babel, one brick at a time.</p>

        I'm currently a PhD student in computer science at Portland State University. A child of an immigrant father 
        from Montenegro and an ESL teacher mother, I grew up in a multilingual household and traveled frequently to Europe.
        This early exposure to different languages and cultures sparked my lifelong fascination with language and the power of communication.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also inspired to study technology after watching Star Wars as a child. My favorite character was C3PO, 
        a protocol droid "fluent in over six million forms of communication" as he liked to boast.  
      </p>
      <p>And that's computational linguistics. The perfect fusion of computers and language.</p>
      <p>
        <i><strong>My goal is to help people communicate better, no matter what language they speak.</strong></i>
        I believe that language is a bridge that connects us all, and I'm committed to building tools that make 
        communication easier and more accessible for everyone.
